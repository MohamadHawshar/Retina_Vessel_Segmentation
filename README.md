In this work, we propose a method for retinal vessel segmentation based on U-nets. The data argument is applied by rotating 45 degrees, horizontally and vertically inverting the training images. Three fully convolutional network architectures, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Unet++: Nested Unets, are used for vessel segmentation. The performance of our method is evaluated on three public datasets: DRIVE, STARE  and CHASE DB1. We use accuracy and area under the ROC curve as the main evaluation metrics, in addition to F1 score, precision, and accuracy.

We concluded that the performance of the two architectures Attention U-net and Unet++ gave close results, with Attention U-net slightly outperforming Unet++ on most measures.
